# Hawaiian_RegimePredictors

This repo was forked from JBjouffray/Hawaii_RegimesPredictors. The folders/files added by me as a part of the SMA project are listed under the What's New part of this README.
The original README is located at README-JouffaryJB.md.

Project
This project was created as part of a class project for CSS229 taught at Stanford University. Our study focuses on analyzing how prediction accuracy of the coral regimes changes depending on the type of classification model used and its complexity. We take both continuous and factor inputs measuring human activity (e.g. new development) and environmental influences (e.g. wave power) and use them to predict the corresponding coral reef regime using a variety of classification methods.

What's New
All the work for our CS229 project is the the /notebooks directory. We left the other files from the previous paper in place. We create additional dataset features and also impute some missing data from the old data.
