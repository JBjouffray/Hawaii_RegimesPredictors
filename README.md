# Hawaiian_RegimePredictors

This repo was forked from JBjouffray/Hawaii_RegimesPredictors. The folders/files added by me as a part of the SMA project are listed under the What's New part of this README. The original README is located at README_JouffaryJB.md.

## Project
This project was created was created as a part of my ICA component for the Statistical Methods and Analysis course.

## What's New
All the work for my project is in the following folders:

- new datasets
- scripts/notebooks
- media
- report

All the other files from the previous paper have been left in place.
