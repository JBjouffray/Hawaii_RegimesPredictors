# Hawaiian_RegimePredictors

This repo was forked from JBjouffray/Hawaii_RegimesPredictors for a project in my Statistical Methods and Analysis course. The folders/files added by me as a part of the SMA project are listed under the 'My additions' part of this README. The original README is located at README_JouffaryJB.md.

## Objectives of the project

- visualize which factors are the most influential in the formation of each regime 
- to predict which regime may found at a location on the Hawaiian islands based on the factors found there

## My additions
All the work for my project is in the following folders:

- new datasets
- scripts/notebooks
- media
- report

All the other files from the previous paper have been left in place.
